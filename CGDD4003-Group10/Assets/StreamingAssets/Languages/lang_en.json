Venus has been colonized and is the key to space travel due to a new element that was found. Virellium, a bright yellow material.","Beginning_Paragraph_1":"However, while this element holds energy levels unseen. It calls forth something darker. Something that should have never been uncovered.","Beginning_Paragraph_2":"The primary research facility located in Sector 0 was the first to succumb to this evil. You must take back this facility at any cost before these creatures of Hell destroy the world. You must exact your revenge, even if it costs you your life.","Ending_Good_Paragraph_0":"Your strength proved greater than theirs. The mission to reclaim the primary facility is complete, though the cost was heavy. As the last echoes of battle fade, the silence of Sector 0 feels uncertain. Did you truly escape what lurked within, or did you only drive it back into the dark? Still, for now, victory belongs to you.","Ending_Good_Paragraph_1":"With the facility secured, humanity regains its lifeline. Virellium flows once more, powering ships, cities, and the future. Your name spreads across Venus as the one who stood against the evil and prevailed. Families speak of you as a savior, and world leaders call you the ultimate protector. Yet the praise does little to quiet the unease that lingers beneath the surface.","Ending_Good_Paragraph_2":"For while humanity is thriving once more, the question remains whether such power can ever be trusted. Virellium fuels peace, but it also fuels ambition and corruption, and greed has never been easily contained. Perhaps the danger was not only in the creatures that rose from the depths, but in what humanity itself might do with what you’ve given back to them.","Ending_Bad_Paragraph_0":"The creatures of Sector 0 proved stronger than you. Your resolve was not enough, and with your fall, the facility lies in ruin. The corruption born of Virellium spreads unchecked, twisting everything it touches. The mission ends in failure, and with it, humanity’s last defense begins to crumble.","Ending_Bad_Paragraph_1":"In your struggle, you uncovered truths that were never meant to be known, secrets buried beneath the research, and the price paid for Virellium’s discovery. Even had you survived, would those in power have allowed you to walk free with such knowledge? Some victories come at a cost too high to be permitted, and now even that choice has been taken from you.","Ending_Bad_Paragraph_2":"With the breach of the facility, the monsters will not remain contained for long. The terrain may slow them, but time favors their hunger. Soon they will spread beyond Venus, and all of humanity will learn what was unleashed in its pursuit of progress. The question that remains is not whether they can be stopped, but whether Virellium was ever worth the price...","Ending_Insanity_Paragraph_0":"The virellium-infused fruit were truly splendid. Once consumed, they changed everything. The monsters no longer seemed like enemies, but instead like guides showing a clearer path. Their vision of the world made more sense than humanity’s endless struggle. Perhaps this was always the truth waiting to be seen.","Ending_Insanity_Paragraph_1":"The mission, the facility, the reason you came here, it all loses meaning. Hunger grows, not for food, but for more Virellium. More power. More control. You are no longer a soldier fighting for survival, but a vessel carrying the will of something greater, something beyond human understanding.","Ending_Insanity_Paragraph_2":"With your fall, the last chance to contain Virellium is gone. Humanity is left to fear what may now rise from Sector 0, and what you yourself have become. Their greed uncovered this nightmare, and now they must live with the consequences. Whether they can fight back, or whether fear will consume them first, remains unknown...","DemoEnd_Paragraph_0":"This is the end of the demo.
